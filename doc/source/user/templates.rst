Templates
=========

Templates usually are simple HTML pages, but with special HTML comments (see
:doc:`variables`) which are to be replaced by the MDiocre conversion process.

One notable aspect of a template is the comment markup even belongs in
parameters, so the template files may not necessarily be well-formed HTML.
